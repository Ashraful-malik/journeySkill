## ✨ What is JourneySkill?

JourneySkill is a platform built to help developers stay accountable and consistent with their learning by creating custom coding challenges. Whether you're starting with JavaScript, diving into a new framework, or building side projects, JourneySkill gives you a structured, motivating space to grow.

## 🌱 Why It Was Built

I started learning web development through challenges like `#100DaysOfCode` and `30-Day Challenges` on Twitter. While posting daily kept me motivated, it was also hard to track progress or stay consistent without a proper system. That experience sparked the idea for JourneySkill — a dedicated space to help developers track their goals, stay on streaks, and build in public with ease.
